abstract="In this paper we propose a new simplicial partition-based deterministic algorithm for global optimization of Lipschitz-continuous functions without requiring any knowledge of the Lipschitz constant. Our algorithm is motivated by the well-known Direct algorithm which evaluates the objective function on a set of points that tries to cover the most promising subregions of the feasible region. Almost all previous modifications of Direct algorithm use hyper-rectangular partitions. However, other types of partitions may be more suitable for some optimization problems. Simplicial partitions may be preferable when the initial feasible region is either already a simplex or may be covered by one or a manageable number of simplices. Therefore in this paper we propose and investigate simplicial versions of the partition-based algorithm. In the case of simplicial partitions, definition of potentially optimal subregion cannot be the same as in the rectangular version. In this paper we propose and investigate two definitions of potentially optimal simplices: one involves function values at the vertices of the simplex and another uses function value at the centroid of the simplex. We use experimental investigation to compare performance of the algorithms with different definitions of potentially optimal partitions. The experimental investigation shows, that proposed simplicial algorithm gives very competitive results to Direct algorithm using standard test problems and performs particularly well when the search space and the numbers of local and global optimizers may be reduced by taking into account symmetries of the objective function.",

abstract="This paper addresses the solution of bound-constrained optimization problems using algorithms that require only the availability of objective function values but no derivative information. We refer to these algorithms as derivative-free algorithms. Fueled by a growing number of applications in science and engineering, the development of derivative-free optimization algorithms has long been studied, and it has found renewed interest in recent time. Along with many derivative-free algorithms, many software implementations have also appeared. The paper presents a review of derivative-free algorithms, followed by a systematic comparison of 22 related implementations using a test set of 502 problems. The test bed includes convex and nonconvex problems, smooth as well as nonsmooth problems. The algorithms were tested under the same conditions and ranked under several criteria, including their ability to find near-global solutions for nonconvex problems, improve a given starting point, and refine a near-optimal solution. A total of 112,448 problem instances were solved. We find that the ability of all these solvers to obtain good solutions diminishes with increasing problem size. For the problems used in this study, TOMLAB/MULTIMIN, TOMLAB/GLCCLUSTER, MCS and TOMLAB/LGO are better, on average, than other derivative-free solvers in terms of solution quality within 2,500 function evaluations. These global solvers outperform local solvers even for convex problems. Finally, TOMLAB/OQNLP, NEWUOA, and TOMLAB/MULTIMIN show superior performance in terms of refining a near-optimal solution.",

abstract="The well known DIRECT (DIviding RECTangles) algorithm for global optimization requires bound constraints on variables and does not naturally address additional linear or nonlinear constraints. A feasible region defined by linear constraints may be covered by simplices, therefore simplicial partitioning may tackle linear constraints in a very subtle way. In this paper we demonstrate this advantage of simplicial partitioning by applying a recently proposed deterministic simplicial partitions based DISIMPL algorithm for optimization problems defined by general linear constraints (Lc-DISIMPL). An extensive experimental investigation reveals advantages of this approach to such problems comparing with different constraint-handling methods, proposed for use with DIRECT. Furthermore the Lc-DISIMPL algorithm gives very competitive results compared to a derivative-free particle swarm algorithm (PSwarm) which was previously shown to give very promising results. Moreover, DISIMPL guarantees the convergence to the global solution, whereas the PSwarm algorithm sometimes fails to converge to the global minimum.",

abstract="The integration of optimization methodologies with computational analyses/simulations has a profound impact on the product design. Such integration, however, faces multiple challenges. The most eminent challenges arise from high-dimensionality of problems, computationally-expensive analysis/simulation, and unknown function properties (i.e., black-box functions). The merger of these three challenges severely aggravates the difficulty and becomes a major hurdle for design optimization. This paper provides a survey on related modeling and optimization strategies that may help to solve High-dimensional, Expensive (computationally), Black-box (HEB) problems. The survey screens out 207 references including multiple historical reviews on relevant subjects from more than 1,000 papers in a variety of disciplines. This survey has been performed in three areas: strategies tackling high-dimensionality of problems, model approximation techniques, and direct optimization strategies for computationally-expensive black-box functions and promising ideas behind non-gradient optimization algorithms. Major contributions in each area are discussed and presented in an organized manner. The survey exposes that direct modeling and optimization strategies to address HEB problems are scarce and sporadic, partially due to the difficulty of the problem itself. Moreover, it is revealed that current modeling research tends to focus on sampling and modeling techniques themselves and neglect studying and taking the advantages of characteristics of the underlying expensive functions. Based on the survey results, two promising approaches are identified to solve HEB problems. Directions for future research are also discussed.",

This initialization technique is a simple and ingenious approach based on elementary concepts of graph theory. Here, the topographical initialization is used to generate good starting points to solve constrained global minimization problems, whose solutions are roots of associated nonlinear systems. To accomplish the task of local search, in the minimization step we use a well-established interior-point method. Our methodology was compared against other methods using benchmarks from the literature. Results indicated that the present approach is a powerful strategy for finding all roots of nonlinear systems.

@article{Wales2015,
abstract = {This perspective focuses on conceptual and computational aspects of the potential energy landscape framework. It has two objectives: first to summarise some key developments of the approach and second to illustrate how such techniques can be applied using a specific example that exploits knowledge of pathways. Recent developments in theory and simulation within the landscape framework are first outlined, including methods for structure prediction, analysis of global thermodynamic properties, and treatment of rare event dynamics. We then develop a connection between the kinetic transition network treatment of dynamics and a potential of mean force defined by a reaction coordinate. The effect of projection from the full configuration space to low dimensionality is illustrated for an atomic cluster. In this example, where a relatively successful structural order parameter is available, the principal change in cluster morphology is reproduced, but some details are not faithfully represented. In contrast, a profile based on configurations that correspond to the discrete path defined geometrically retains all the barriers and minima. This comparison provides insight into the physical origins of ???friction??? effects in low-dimensionality descriptions of dynamics based upon a reaction coordinate.},

@article{Jamil2013,
abstract = {Test functions are important to validate and compare the performance of optimization algorithms. There have been many test or benchmark functions reported in the literature; however, there is no standard list or set of benchmark functions. Ideally, test functions should have diverse properties so that can be truly useful to test new algorithms in an unbiased way. For this purpose, we have reviewed and compiled a rich set of 175 bench-mark functions for unconstrained optimization problems with diverse properties in terms of modality, separability, and valley landscape. This is by far the most complete set of functions so far in the literature, and tt can be expected this complete set of functions can be used for validation of new optimization in the future.},
